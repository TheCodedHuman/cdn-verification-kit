# cdn-verification-kit

A lightweight, embeddable JavaScript kit for **user verification**.  
Drop this script into any website and it will:

- Collect basic metadata (browser, OS, screen, language, timestamp, etc)
- Send it to your backend (Flask or any API)
- Receive a decision (`allow: true/false`) from your ML model
- Show a verification overlay until the decision is made

This kit is **CDN-ready**, modular, and designed for scalable trust layers.
